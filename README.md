## Features  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw datasets.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering patterns and correlations in the data.  
3. **Model Development**: Implementation of regression models such as:  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Random Forests  
   - Gradient Boosting (optional)  
4. **Model Evaluation**: Performance assessment using metrics like MSE and RÂ² Score.  
5. **Visualization**: Graphs and interactive plots to display trends and results.
